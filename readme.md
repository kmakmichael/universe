# Across the Universe

## About
*Across the Universe* is a data visualization project, created for University of the Pacific's Virtual Reality course (COMP 253).
Via data pulled from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, users can explore nearby galaxies in virtual reality, with 6 degrees of movement.
The scale of the dataset can also be adjusted, allowing the user to see all the galaxies in a tight cluster or to zoom in on areas of interest.

## Progress
The project is in a very early alpha state, and only offers limited functionality.
Only a certain set of nearby objects are visible (those with a redshift below 0.1), the visuals are very undeveloped, and the controls need fine-tuning to be more smooth and intuitive.
The asset used for the galaxies was pulled from Google Images without regard for usage rights, and as such must be replaced before any formal release.

## Operation
The program can be controlled via two modes of operation: interactive mode and starmap mode.
Switching between modes is performed by clicking the joystick.
In interactive mode, movement is performed relative to the direction the user is facing.
The joystick controls horizontal movement, and the triggers control vertical movement.
The universe's scale can be changed with the thumb buttons.
In starmap mode, the same controls apply but move the universe relative the origin.
A compass in the center of the starmap points towards the origin, which is placed at the Milky Way Galaxy.
